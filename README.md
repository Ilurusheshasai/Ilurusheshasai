 Would like to work on artificial intelligence
 I want to think freely and creatively as possible try to tap ideas that are never been worked on, become a programmer who can code the idea into reality, and participate in coding competitions.
 See lots of amazing places on earth and show them to the people close to me.

 **Noticeable work**  
 Trained an open-source LLM to detect SQL Injection to leverage LLM pattern identification capabilities and proved why this is effective instead of using simple ML algorithms.

 Developed a model that can act as a simple search engine on a local database and can summarize and answer questions from the files.
 In this context, I used a folder with some stories and created a chatbot that can summarize and answer questions on stories to make them interesting. It was a long process and I have achieved improvement step by step.
